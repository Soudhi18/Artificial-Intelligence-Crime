# Artificial-Intelligence-Crime
# Overview
This project is an Artificial Intelligence Crime developed using HTML, CSS, Python, Django, MySQL and Machine Learning techniques. The system aims to analyze crime data and predict criminal activities using various machine learning algorithms such as Naive Bayes, Extra Tree Classifier, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression, and Decision Tree Classifier.

# Features
* Crime data analysis and prediction.
* Multiple machine learning algorithms for crime prediction.
* Web-based interface for user interaction.
* Secure MySQL database integration for data storage.
* Easy deployment using Django framework.

# Dataset
The system uses a crime dataset for training and testing the machine learning algorithms. Ensure that your dataset is appropriately formatted and contains relevant features for crime prediction.

# Machine Learning Algorithms
The following machine learning algorithms are implemented for crime prediction:

1. Naive Bayes
2. Extra Tree Classifier
3. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
4. Logistic Regression
5. Decision Tree Classifier

# Usage
1. Start the Django development server.
2. Navigate to the web application through your browser.
3. Interact with the system by inputting crime data or selecting options for prediction.
4. View the predicted criminal activities based on selected machine learning algorithms.
